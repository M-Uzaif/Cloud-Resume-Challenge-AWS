# Cloud-Resume-Challenge-AWS-
# Project Overview
This project is an implementation of the Cloud Resume Challenge, showcasing a static website resume hosted on AWS with various cloud services integrated. The resume is built with HTML and CSS, and includes a visitor counter implemented with JavaScript and AWS services.

# What's in the Project
Static Website

HTML file (index.html) containing the resume content
CSS file (styles.css) for styling the resume
JavaScript file (script.js) for implementing the visitor counter
AWS Services Used

S3: Hosts the static website files
CloudFront: Provides HTTPS and caching
Lambda: Runs the backend logic for the visitor counter
API Gateway: Creates a RESTful API for the visitor counter
DynamoDB: Stores the visitor count
CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions workflow for automating deployments to S3
What I Learned
Through this project, I gained valuable experience and knowledge in cloud computing and web development:

Cloud Services: I learned the basics of cloud computing and how to use various AWS services like S3, CloudFront, Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.

Static Website Hosting: I learned how to host a static website on Amazon S3 and serve it securely using CloudFront.

Serverless Computing: I gained experience with serverless architecture by implementing a Lambda function for the visitor counter.

Database Management: I learned how to use DynamoDB, a NoSQL database service, to store and retrieve data.

API Development: I learned how to create and use a RESTful API with API Gateway to connect my frontend to the Lambda function.

CI/CD Practices: I implemented a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, learning about automated deployment processes.

Frontend Development: I improved my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by building a responsive resume website.

Version Control: I gained more experience with Git and GitHub for managing my project's source code.

Security Best Practices: I learned about securing cloud applications, including using HTTPS and managing AWS credentials securely.

Cloud Cost Management: I gained awareness of how to use cloud services cost-effectively, utilizing AWS's free tier where possible.

This project provided hands-on experience with cloud technologies and modern web development practices, serving as an excellent introduction to cloud computing and its real-world applications.
