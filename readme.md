# 🌥️ Cloud Resume Challenge

Welcome to my **Cloud Resume Challenge** project!\
This is a hands-on implementation of the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/), showcasing a static resume website hosted entirely on AWS, integrated with modern cloud services, serverless architecture, and CI/CD practices.

---

## 📄 Project Overview

This project demonstrates my skills in both **cloud computing** and **web development** by building and deploying a static website resume using AWS services. The website features a visitor counter powered by serverless backend technologies.

## 🧾 What's in the Project?

### 🔧 Frontend - Static Website

- `index.html` – Resume content
- `styles.css` – Website styling
- `script.js` – JavaScript logic for the visitor counter

### ☁️ AWS Services Used

| Service         | Purpose                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S3**          | Hosts the static website files                          |
| **CloudFront**  | Enables HTTPS, CDN caching, and global content delivery |
| **Lambda**      | Executes backend logic for visitor counter              |
| **API Gateway** | Creates RESTful API to connect frontend with backend    |
| **DynamoDB**    | NoSQL database to store and retrieve visitor count      |

### 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates deployment of website files to the S3 bucket.

## 💡 What I Learned

This project gave me real-world experience with modern cloud technologies and development practices:

- **Cloud Services**: Learned how to use AWS services like S3, CloudFront, Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.
- **Static Website Hosting**: Hosted a secure, scalable website using S3 and CloudFront.
- **Serverless Computing**: Implemented backend logic using AWS Lambda.
- **Database Management**: Used DynamoDB to store website visitor counts.
- **API Development**: Built a RESTful API using API Gateway and integrated it with frontend JavaScript.
- **CI/CD Practices**: Created a GitHub Actions workflow to automate deployments.
- **Frontend Development**: Improved my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.
- **Version Control**: Used Git and GitHub for source control and collaboration.
- **Security Best Practices**: Learned to manage AWS credentials and enforce HTTPS securely.
- **Cloud Cost Management**: Optimized usage within AWS Free Tier to manage costs effectively.
